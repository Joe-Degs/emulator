This project is inspired by [gamozolabs](https://github.com/gamozolabs) [Fuzz
Week 2020](https://gamozolabs.github.io/2020/07/12/fuzz_week_2020.html).

He does things you are scared to do and encourages you to do it because the only way to know how to do things is actually trying to do them. Check out his [youtube](https://youtube.com/user/gamozolabs).

__I have very little knowledge in systems programming and programming in general
and I learn by following along streams and youtube tutorials__
